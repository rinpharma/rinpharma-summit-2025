<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, <strong>R in Pharma</strong> was in-person at Harvard University and focused on opportunities for direct interaction with speakers and guests.<br>
These relationships and connections have grown into many exciting areas of Open Source drug development.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>2023</strong> we partnered with <em>Posit</em>, hosting an in-person session at posit::conf(2023) in Chicago.<br>
</li>
<li>In <strong>2024</strong>, the session continued at posit::conf(2024) in Seattle.<br>
</li>
<li>We’re thrilled to bring this back at <strong>posit::conf(2025)</strong> in Atlanta! 🎉</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Over the last five years we’ve seen an explosive growth in the use of R and other open source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on <strong>pan-company collaboration</strong>.</p>
<p>The R/Pharma Roundtable Summit provides an <strong>open, collaborative, and inclusive environment</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share learnings<br>
</li>
<li>Understand common themes across our industry<br>
</li>
<li>Establish collaboration opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is to foster <strong>in-person discussions</strong> about key items such as <em>reproducibility</em> and <em>submissions</em>, much like the original Harvard events.</p>

<h1>Roundtable Summaries</h1>
<p>During the R/Pharma summit, each roundtable session chair shared a summary of their group’s discussion at the conclusion of the event. This year, we recorded the audio of these summaries to local <code>mp3</code> audio files, and leveraged the OpenAI <code>whisper</code> audio transcription LLM run entirely locally on a computer to generate transcripts of the audio summaries. Lastly, these transcripts were summarized using the Anthropic model within Positron Assistant to create summaries of these transcripts. You can view the summaries and source transcripts of the roundtable sessions below.</p>

<p>Okay, so we discussed a couple of topics in this. One of them, I’ll go one by one, the usability where we are currently using. We talked about using it for chatbots, for ADM, Adam TLF coding standards, general coding support and automation. I think there was somebody who also asked if we could even generate specifications from SAPs and study documents so that you could complete the loop like, you know, specs as well as code generation. We talked about where we are using it in clinical operations. One, I think there’s somebody who is using it to improve operational efficiency and another person also indicated that they are using it for signal detection for safety monitoring. In terms of implementation strategy, we wanted to break these problems into manageable pipelines, start with POCs and leverage domain knowledge as a key asset. You want to take the next one? Thank you. And some of the issues and other barriers that were discussed, in terms of the technicality, like data privacy came up a lot and how do you handle sensitive clinical data from not, you know, falling off? And there was also traceability, repeatability, and how do you control the quality? And hallucination of the AI itself was also mentioned. And this other aspect of, I guess, in terms of implementation, people trying to wipe code into producing a manageable solution which doesn’t seem to work. So these are some of the technical implementation issues that were discussed. In terms of the organizational hurdles, broader implementation like management not being on board just because of the habits they are used to and the return of investment challenge, validation, repeatability as well. And there is also a need for comprehensive user training when especially when trying to implement a process change using AI. There’s also concerns about job displacement due to AI that were mentioned. And finally regulatory and compliance like maintaining an audit as well as ensuring complete documentation and transparency of pathways. And how do you ensure it’s meeting the industry quality standards? And finally implementing proper guardrails and controls on sensitive data in terms of the regulatory where some of the other issues discussed.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>very much a Shiny-centric kind of spin to our validation discussion, where we had some interesting use cases about how Shiny, of course, you can set a lot of inputs and make dynamic changes in your UI of whatever table or plot you’re making. But then when you want to actually validate the results of those selections, there were some interesting cases where you might use a different even language in and of itself to do that, such as SAS, to look at how those outputs are being generated. So that was an interesting idea I never really thought about. But it also underscored the importance of, it’s one thing just to do the business logic kind of validation. I talked about my morning session. But you do need that kind of user-centric, dynamic look at what outputs you’re generating and making sure you’re on track with validating those. So I think there’s some opportunity to learn from each other on that side of it, too. And then, actually, you, Phil, you had a great comment about the number of conferences, some of the stigma that R has is a, quote unquote, lack of backward compatibility, which I personally wonder where that’s coming from, especially what BASE are, because they are very rigid to changing. But there are, obviously, things you need to consider with how you manage, say, your package versioning and documenting whenever big changes are occurring there, too. And then trying to think back on whatever parts we talked about. I think we talked about ShinyTest. Oh, yeah. And we also talked about ways to do testing in Shiny, specifically with ShinyTest, too. And there was some interesting new tooling that’s coming out from our friends at the Taurus, it sounds like, coming up very soon with augmenting that with automated reporting and screenshots that we’re going to be eager to see as we go forward with that side of it, too. One last thing, we talked about ShinyMeta and Teal. Yep. And then, yeah, exactly. So then Teal came up quite a bit, as we often see, that’s a great use case to get buy-in from an organization to leverage Shiny in the clinical area. But then you think about how they are approaching creating those reproducible scripts that you can get to, in essence, carry out what you did in the Teal app. And they went away from the ShinyMeta route that, Rosie, who had been at our farm before, that package from Posit actually was born from conversations with some of us with the Shiny team back then. But it never really got as much adoption as I think maybe it was anticipated. So we are interested to see the way Teal conducts this, if that’s a pattern that ends up being more standard in the future, always learning from what’s working well there and maybe where that can go in the validation discussion when you think about teams that say, oh, you did that great analysis in that app, but I need to be able to run that in a month from now or even a year from now, maybe to answer a question. So we do see some intriguing ideas that Teal has pioneered with getting those scripts out there. And last, but certainly not least, there were some questions about how to handle larger data in apps. And myself and others were quick to literally mouth off. DuckDB is a very promising approach so that you can have that within that environment database feature, but yet you’re not overhead of a Postgres or even NoSQL database that often came up, too. But we think DuckDB and Shiny is a great combination for big data analytics that I think will play nicely in Noveltoon in the future.</p>
<p>So we were talking mostly about package validation during both validation roundtables, and there are companies that they already built both the exploratory and the validated GXP environments, and there are a lot of companies that are just building the GXP environments, and the cycles and the processes vary, and there could be an approach where the validation cycle takes, that happens every six or even every 12 months. However, there is one company that takes more agile and fluid approach where the package validation can be completed in just a few hours, and I think that demonstrates that both speed and compliance can coexist in a proper process. And we discussed that managing the infrastructure actually is a challenge with a lot of packages and a lot of images being created, and that a good approach that can be taken in the future is to create a base image that can be specific per project or specific for a therapeutic area, and this is a container, and Kubernetes seem to be the standard for managing those. And however, container sizing continues to present a technical challenge. What else? We also discussed that the transparency for our packages packs, that this is actually a positive thing, because with SAS you don’t really know, you only know about your own bag that you submitted, but you don’t know about the other bags, and they for sure exist, and with the open source you get access, you see what happens, and you see how those bags are resolved, so we thought that this is actually a good thing. And we also agreed that internal packages, they should follow the same process as external packages, so there needs to be testing, and that actually testing, the tester should be a separate person than the developer. And we also covered a bit the topic of testing, thank you, testing the GenAI outputs, and we concluded that basically there needs to be a code that is reproducible, and this needs to be tested, and this needs to be validated as well. And I think one more thing that was quite interesting is that we don’t have a standard what the validated package means, and that every company basically defines their own way what it means that the package is validated. And regarding also the GenAI principles and validating the outputs, we thought that right now, basically we have to decide on principles regarding the GenAI, because right now we don’t state that, for example, the documentation was generated by the GenAI, and we thought that this would be valuable, because this gives additional context, and it can mean that you also would pay additional extra attention to that part, because you know that this was not generated by the human. And last but not least, we discussed whether AI bot to help evaluate if the test is good, it can be something useful, and it can be used as an extra pair of eyes. There were mixed opinions that yes, this could be useful, however, this can also make the reviewers a bit mindless, because they would rely too much on the advice and the output from the bot. Thank you.</p>

<p>So a couple of things, I’m going to start with a question that we had more towards the end because what is seen from the table that we were is that there is some heterogeneity on the usage of it. Some people are actually in the medical device space, some people are in the pharma space and for medical devices, a lot of the people that have used Python are engineers and they are more familiar to this, which end up becoming very much their standard language for them to use, which created an interesting thing. It becomes very difficult to manage multiple languages sometimes and in this particular case, this company has decided that they are just using Python even though there are some challenges in that space. We have a couple of different topics that we were discussing. One of them is regarding the use cases. So of course for medical devices, the use cases are very different than what’s in pharma. The kind of data that is coming from devices, large data sets, kind of forces the use of Python in a different way. There is also a little bit of a medical device space. You’re also thinking not only about the data analysis but an actual product that’s going to be created in the end after the data analysis, which is more difficult to be developed in R, in that space. But I think that one of the things that drives some of the use cases, especially for pharma, is speed, and because of that, a lot of ETLs, maybe machine learning, data engineering is really the space where pharma is looking into the usage of Python. Of course, another team was validation, that James already mentioned a little bit about this. What do we do about validation of Python? I think when the R validation hub created the white paper, even though it’s an R paper, it was meant to be language agnostic. We did put a lot of stuff that was there because that’s what we were working on, but we talked about it. Should we just make this language agnostic at the time? We decided not, but I think the principles are the same. Of course, it does raise a lot of different questions because there are assumptions in the R validation white paper that we do for R that are a little maybe easier to get from evidence perspective. For example, what’s a trusted source? And what is a trusted source in Python? I think that we heard in the table that things coming from Anaconda or maybe PyPy with maybe some RSPM may be reasonable, but also that you have to put some scrutiny around this because it’s not, again, Python is more of a wide west in comparison to R. There’s just so much more stuff going on and we have to have all that in consideration. An interesting comment, the statistics in Python, I mean, packages or libraries that are doing statistics, I think that what we heard from one person, one company, is that the groundwork to make sure that those statistical analysis is being vetted, it’s still a little early. It’s like R was like eight years back maybe, so there’s a little bit of that going on and that’s in the space for Python. There’s some discussion in the validation about the use of containers and a couple of other questions that you have that we posed in the end was Python and GenAI, so as you see, there’s a lot of GenAI, when I talk about GenAI, there’s a lot of stuff that’s going on in Python just because it’s a more used language and that may be driven or driving some of the, where the languages are going. There is some conversation about Python versus R and one thing that R is definitely ahead is the fact that submission and regulatory acceptance is already being developed, so no one has really got a Python submission yet, as far as I know, and that is groundwork that has to be done. Submission, pilot number 10, pilot 15, Eric, pilot 15, Eric, for you, and I guess the other thing is really in regards to the limitations that may be in R for certain types of data sets, gene data sets, genetic data sets and so forth because of the size of the data. Did I, is there something else that I, okay, so that’s it. Thank you.</p>

<p>and David’s. So we start off saying there’s three components to an SCE, and then we listed out five different components. So the first one was the IDE, there’s file and version management, data and access, the governance, and then the actual compute. In terms of scope, I don’t think we had an agreed scope for what actually is in an SCE. Historically, that might be defined by department structure, and it seemed it was kind of a common theme that in the legacy world, you had an SCE for GXP work and an SCE for everything else. And it seemed most companies want to have a single SCE going forwards. We talked a little bit about vendors and how some vendors kind of promise to package everything together into an ecosystem. But people tend to be quite a little bit afraid of that because of vendor lock-in. And also, there’s often missing integrations. And I think we were hypothesizing some of those are strategic to kind of force you to stay within the ecosystem. We, yeah, there are a couple of platforms specifically called out for that. And I think one comment that was made is there’s also that kind of concern around the total cost of ownership. So if you have to string together a whole bunch of different vendors to build your SCE, you kind of start ballooning the costs. And there’s overlap between the different vendor products. And at least in the modern SCEs, there’s often really diverse users in there, like PK, Biostat, Stats Programming, and other groups all on the same platform. Validation takes a long time. I think my own company seemed to be longest at three months to validate the SCE. But it seemed it was always a kind of a slow process. And the test suites themselves add a lot of burden just to maintain those because you have to update the test suites whenever something changes in the platform. There’s a bit of a debate whether the IDE should be part of the validation environment or should it be kept outside. So the IDE is kind of repeated across as a layer on top of your validated containers. And there was a discussion also on, do we validate a system or a process? And I think the best practice was to qualify the systems and focus validation just on the process. A few companies mentioned Python was coming in. So this is in the clinical reporting space, usually for transformations. How to validate Python is a challenge, though, because it doesn’t have a standardized documentation and testing framework like R. I think one company mentioned that they have an opinionated list of R packages. So you can’t just get any package validated. They tried to put some governance on what are the packages they’re validating. Parquet seems to have replaced SAS7bdat as the data format within modern SCEs. For environment management, either three or six months seems to be a common window to update the base environments. A couple of companies decoupled the R package from the environment, but that doesn’t seem to be the norm. One company mentioned that they have a tool. So if the users are kind of interactively modifying their environments, it can flag whether that environment is one of the managed ones for a production run and could also tell if it was an upcoming planned environment, which I thought was a cool thing to open source if that company was interested. And it was really important to think about consistency of environments. So if you have a container in the SCE, the Shiny app should also be able to access that container. The HPC should be able to access that container and the like. And the last two topics, one of them was Git for version control. It seemed that was the direction most companies are going in, but we really had to acknowledge there was a change management issue there with the learning curve. And we discussed some of the complications around data access, particularly in Shiny. So kind of passing through the viewer of the application’s data access. And there was mention of a couple of technologies to help. One was Denodo, and also AWS’s data zone as a way of kind of putting a middle layer to help manage that. Thank you.</p>

<p>open source change management: I think the first thing when it comes to change management is the why before we actually talk about the how. And I think it’s important to keep the perspective of change management is about risk. And there’s a saying that I did not make up even though no one at my table had heard about it. You can’t get, no one has ever gotten fired for buying IBM. And that saying means that like, if everyone does things a certain way, no one’s gonna get in trouble if something happens with like that way. And so you’re asking people to change the way they do analysis. And so management and people who aren’t like in this room basically see the downsides pretty obviously, but then your job as sort of thought leaders is to show them the upsides. And I think a big one is mentioned stuff like collaboration, AI, like I think AI is like oregano, everyone wants to sprinkle AI on everything. So mission AI and those things, and that’ll help to make the conversation a little bit about like, yes, you see the downsides, but moving more towards the upsides. I think the R-validation hub is a big, big benefit. I think you can show that there is a process, you can show stuff like risk metric, and that’ll sort of help to ameliorate some of the concerns about change, but it won’t eliminate them. When it comes to actually making the change, I think we talked a little bit about training, either buying it or doing it yourself. I think one thing to keep in mind is that when it comes to training, the best training is the training that you do yourself. So I think you need to find the right people to help make that change. I think a big thing about, especially open source change management, is environment, and I’m talking about like SCE stuff, James already solved that, so you’re fine, but work on your environment, make sure that people feel comfortable in that environment, especially if there are ways to sort of, before you make a big investment, do some kind of trials with that. For change management, communication is key. Make sure you have the right people, give the right message. I think a lot of people push back if you’re like, you have to change, you have to do it this way now. Expect some pushback. And then one of the biggest things that is a change from closed source analysis to open source is a lot of stuff about package issues. A lot of companies, they just have like one, one single sort of package that gets updated every couple of years. Obviously, this open source is much more dynamic, and so you need to maybe explain a little bit more how like software works, because if there’s an error, it could be that your code is fine, but maybe you have a, maybe the version needs to be updated, and explaining stuff like packaging, and I think a big part of that is containerization, either RAM for Docker or something, I think that’ll make that change process a lot easier.</p>
<p>So we have the, for our roundtable, we’re talking about open source change management, and then we try to tackle that problem from the three pillars of change management, people, technology, and process. And for the people side, we talk about to get the momentum started, oftentimes we need very specific use cases showing that by using our Python, we can generate this very complicated tables and the graph is very easily. And then we talk about that, actually grassroot effort can only get us to a certain level and at the end of the day, we really need kind of top down decisions and then those incentives coming from the leadership team and also having those messages repeatedly like from the leadership team. And we see a trend that from mid-size and large companies, like there are creation of independent innovation groups. So we acknowledge that if like change management is a side job of someone’s, like in complimentary to someone’s day job of filing, et cetera, it’s always getting deprioritized. So we see a trend of creating those innovation teams. And we talk a little bit about hiring versus training. And we talk about for internal training, we want to have those just in time training. We see many cases that we train people, they go back to SAS work and they forgot about the training. And it seems like there is a trend that for many companies, they start to remove SAS in their job description. And we see that people are, for younger generation, we are hiring our Python programmers from day zero. And then in terms of another thing I found very interesting that in terms of people influence, we also have some discussion about this is also a good time to influence our internal standard group because there are many trivial decisions in internal standard or limitations or historical reasons from like legacy tools or legacy technology limitations. So it’s a good timing to influence them and then to kind of like reset the baseline a little bit. In terms of technology, we spend quite some time talking about Git, kind of double click on the conversation this morning. Like it’s absolutely the foundation of adoption of open source languages and also the AI tools. In terms of process, we talk about Git again, and we also talk about there are also unique opportunity for us to rethink about our clinical trial reporting process. For example, we see that in some companies, like by using Shiny, actually we can reduce number of TLGs or even get rid of the generation of static TLF for a certain reporting event. So I think that there is an opportunity to rethink what really makes sense for clinical trial reporting.</p>

<p>So yeah, we had a good discussion. I’m going to differentiate probably between the more innovative CROs that I think are here versus the more traditional groups that tend to dominate the industry a lot but are obviously a big part of what’s going on. So the consensus view is that there’s a big challenge in the CRO space because one, SAS is still a big part of the workflow and the process that everybody is working through and dealing with. And so the requirements to upskill people and to change that paradigm, it falls a bit on the CRO. And it’s a decision that they have to make in terms of how they’re looking at the market. And so I think a lot of these groups are looking for maybe more guidance from the sponsor side or perhaps sponsors that are more set on a certain path as opposed to expecting them to manage both. And in that sense, they’ve become a bit of a bottleneck because they’re trying to figure it out on their own but they don’t always know where to go in some of these strategies. I think the other thing is though that we did talk about on the other side of that, CROs also can be a really great resource for organizations that are looking to make this transition because they have a lot of internal experience working on a lot of different studies and projects across a lot of different clients. So they’re not often set up to be consultants. They’re really more kind of order takers or process-focused organizations. But they’re pivoting a bit to try to support more of those activities as clients are demanding it of them. Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of discussion around do sponsors understand that the upskilling and the change is taking time and that there are certain requirements that need to be dealt with? And I think there’s a question there as to whether a lot of sponsors understand that. But it also just kind of fits in with the business model and the expectations. The other big, I guess the other big topic everybody discussed is the importance of being part of an organization like this because there’s a lot of information available to people as they’re trying to work through some of these topics. And perhaps an emphasis of getting more CROs involved in this discussion could be pretty useful because they are a pretty big player in the overall kind of ecosystem that we all work in. Thank you.</p>
