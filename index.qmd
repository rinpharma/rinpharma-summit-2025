# Background

In 2018 and 2019, **R in Pharma** was in-person at Harvard University and focused on opportunities for direct interaction with speakers and guests.  
These relationships and connections have grown into many exciting areas of Open Source drug development.  

- In **2023** we partnered with *Posit*, hosting an in-person session at posit::conf(2023) in Chicago.  
- In **2024**, the session continued at posit::conf(2024) in Seattle.  
- We‚Äôre thrilled to bring this back at **posit::conf(2025)** in Atlanta! üéâ

---

Over the last five years we‚Äôve seen an explosive growth in the use of R and other open source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on **pan-company collaboration**.  

The R/Pharma Roundtable Summit provides an **open, collaborative, and inclusive environment** to:

- Share learnings  
- Understand common themes across our industry  
- Establish collaboration opportunities  

The focus is to foster **in-person discussions** about key items such as *reproducibility* and *submissions*, much like the original Harvard events.
