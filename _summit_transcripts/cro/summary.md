### Current Industry Landscape
* **SAS Dominance**: SAS remains a major part of CRO workflows and processes
* **Innovation Gap**: Differentiation between innovative CROs (smaller, forward-thinking) and traditional CROs (larger, dominant market players)

### Key Challenges for CROs
* **Upskilling Requirements**: Need to invest in training staff on new technologies while maintaining SAS capabilities
* **Dual Technology Management**: Challenge of managing both traditional and modern toolchains
* **Guidance Dependency**: Many CROs seeking more direction from sponsor companies rather than self-directing change
* **Business Model Constraints**: Traditional "order taker" model doesn't align well with consulting-style technology guidance

### CRO as Resource vs. Bottleneck
* **Bottleneck Risk**: CROs can become bottlenecks when trying to figure out technology transitions independently
* **Valuable Resource Potential**: CROs have extensive cross-client experience that could be leveraged for best practices
* **Service Evolution**: Pivoting from process-focused to more consultative roles as clients demand technology expertise

### Sponsor-CRO Relationship Dynamics
* **Timeline Expectations**: Question whether sponsors understand the time required for upskilling and technology changes
* **Communication Gap**: Need for better understanding between sponsors and CROs regarding transition requirements
* **Business Model Evolution**: Traditional expectations may need adjustment for new technology paradigms

### Community Engagement
* **Information Access**: Importance of CROs participating in organizations like R/Pharma for knowledge sharing
* **Ecosystem Integration**: CROs are significant players in the overall life sciences technology ecosystem
* **Increased Participation**: Need for more CRO involvement in industry technology discussions
