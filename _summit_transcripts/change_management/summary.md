### The Foundation: Why Before How
* **Risk Management**: Change management is fundamentally about managing risk
* **Breaking the IBM Rule**: "No one gets fired for buying IBM" - need to show upsides of change to overcome conservative mindset
* **Value Proposition**: Emphasize collaboration benefits, AI integration opportunities, and modern capabilities

### Three Pillars of Change Management

#### People
* **Grassroots vs. Top-Down**: Grassroots efforts have limits; executive support and repeated messaging from leadership essential
* **Innovation Teams**: Trend toward creating dedicated innovation groups rather than making change management a side job
* **Hiring vs. Training**: 
  - Just-in-time training more effective than advance training
  - Trend toward hiring R/Python programmers from day one
  - Removing SAS requirements from job descriptions
* **Standards Influence**: Good opportunity to influence internal standards and reset limitations from legacy tools

#### Technology
* **Git Foundation**: Essential foundation for open source adoption and AI tool integration
* **Environment Management**: Focus on Statistical Computing Environment (SCE) setup
* **Containerization**: Important for managing package versioning issues (R+ENV, Docker)

#### Process
* **Version Control**: Git as key process improvement
* **Reporting Innovation**: Opportunities to rethink clinical trial reporting (e.g., using Shiny to reduce static TLFs)
* **Communication Strategy**: Right people delivering right messages, expect pushback, avoid mandate-style approaches

### Key Success Factors
* **R Validation Hub**: Valuable resource for demonstrating process and risk metrics
* **Specific Use Cases**: Show concrete examples of complex tables/graphs generated easily
* **Environment Comfort**: Ensure users feel comfortable in the new environment
* **Package Management**: Education about dynamic nature of open source vs. traditional single-package updates
* **Trial Periods**: Implement trials before major investments
