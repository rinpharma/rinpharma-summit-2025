# R/Pharma Summit (in-person event Monday, September 15)

## Background

In 2018 and 2019, R in Pharma was in-person at Harvard University and focused on opportunities for direct interaction with speakers and guests. These relationships and connections have grown into many exciting areas of Open Source drug development. In 2023 we partnered with Posit, hosting an in-person session at posit::conf 2023 in Chicago and 2024 in Seattle. We're thrilled to bring this back at posit::conf 2025.

Over the last 5 years weâ€™ve seen an explosive growth in the use of R and other open source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on open source projects and pan-company collaboration. In this 1-day series of roundtables we aim to provide an open, collaborative, and inclusive environment to share learnings, understand common themes across our industry, and establish collaboration opportunities. The focus of the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit is to foster in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, submissions etc.) as we did at Harvard.

Posit and R/Pharma are excited to announce that the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit is returning for posit::conf(2025). Over the last few years, representatives from ~40 companies met in-person to discuss some of the most pressing topics pharma is tackling to bring data science to late stage development. We are excited to continue the conversations this year on September 15th in Atlanta. The in-person R/Pharma program at posit::conf(2025) will focus on the future of drug development using open source and tailoredfor program leaders and people leading Open Source initiatives. The 2023/4 review of the Summit (then called 'round-tables') is here: https://rinpharma.github.io/roundtables/

During the 2025 R/Pharma Summit, facilitators will foster in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, interactivity, submissions, scalability, etc.) with industry leaders about open-source tools for next-generation submissions.The 2024 advisory board, shaping the agenda and planned actions for the event, spans >10 pharma companies, as well as CROs and academic research centers.
